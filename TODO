[ ] test all exceptions

[ ] "updates a relation id with original relation loaded" for belongsToMany
[ ] remove bluebird

BREAKING CHANGES:
`plugins` and `models` store config does not autoload via `glob`
`paranoid` plugin scope is not `withDeleted`
`join()` does an inner join by default
failed validations will throw an error
`save`, `delete`, `create`,... won't return `success`, but instead the record itself
hooks must return a promise. The `done` callback was removed
`create`, `save`, `destroy`, ... won't take callbacks any more. use `.then(callback)`
relations wont be saved anymore. except you set autoSave to `true` (store or per relation)
related records are Promises. Access loaded data directly via `record._relationname`
`limit(1)` does not return a single record anymore. Use `first()` or `singleRecord()` instead
`logger` options on store is no longer available. openrecord now uses the `debug` module
