[ ] postgres composite type query
[ ] `this.belongsTo('alternative', {model: 'Food', foreign_key: 'food_id'})` sollte kein foreign_key brauchen!
[ ] Broken relations should not load without any conditions!
[ ] lazy connection -> one Promise for all record relations - which will load relations bulk!

BREAKING CHANGES:
`plugins` and `models` store config does not autoload via `glob`
`paranoid` plugin scope is not `withDeleted`
`join()` does an inner join by default
failed validations will throw an error
`save`, `delete`, `create`,... won't return `success`, but instead the record itself
hooks must return a promise. The `done` callback was removed
`create`, `save`, `destroy`, ... won't take callbacks any more. use `.then(callback)`
relations wont be saved anymore. except you set autoSave to `true`
